Blog Project

This is a group project worked on during the WIN program. In collaboration with 3 other full stack developers and a project manager, we designed and created a sample blog website for Carolina Fintech Hub.

We had user stories using Jira to delegate tasks and stand-up meetings daily to replicate a week-long sprint activity. Throughout the process we utilized github to work on the project collectively. Each person was tasked with different parts for the project and also collaborated to work together to get the project up and running.
